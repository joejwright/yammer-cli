A Yammer Command Line Interface
===============================

This is a simple command line interface for Yammer that can be used to quickly lookup and post new updates.

Usage
-----
    ./yammer.rb -u "Yammer from the command line is so much quicker!" (post update)

    ./yammer.rb -l (list last 20 updates)

Right now you'll have to manually configure your OAuth token and secret in the source code.

TODO
----

* Add better support for configuring OAuth credentials
